We've all got production critical services that rely on one or more solutions we put in place long ago. We wrote those solutions, unsurprisingly, to solve problems - and they did, or they wouldn't still be in use. That means legacy code is valuable - and valuable investments shouldn't just be tossed out the window without a second thought. This talk will cover how you can get your legacy code under control by evaluating, documenting, and adding tests to it - and how doing so will enable you to begin to update and replace your legacy scripts safely and more quickly than before. You'll learn about: - Inline Documentation - Reference Documentation - Characterization Tests - Unit Tests - Concept Documentation - Source Control Practices We'll use an example legacy script to dissect at each stage of the process, showing how you can go about getting your legacy code under control - and how you can use these same practices on your new code to save yourself the future work.

Let's take that one step further and demo all those things and what you should do instead. We'll explain why it's bad and the other way is better, because code without context doesn't help anyone. A lot of talks about ""Best Practice"" are aimed at showing you what you should be doing but not many take the approach of showing what you shouldn't be doing and how to change it. This can make it more difficult to grasp as it might not easily relate to how someone is currently working or has been working, showing the wrong way to do things is more approachable as everyone was a beginner at some point and many people made the same mistakes.

There's a lot of potential change that can happen in how we run our applications. What does the IT operations professional bring to the table when we start taking VMs out of the picture? One answer to that is in how we evolve our monitoring. For ages, we have focused our monitoring infrastructure watching things like CPU utilization and number of page faults in RAM access. We stress over disk queue lengths and network response times. Once we move out of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), our visibility into these indicators change. We need to move up the stack and find out what application metrics we can use to provide similar insight (or even better) into the state of our application environments. This provides one path for us to take our operational experience and apply it to things like Platform as a Service (PaaS), Functions as a Service (FaaS), or hosted container environments. We will take a sample application running on a virtual machine and a few related perf counters, convert them into application metrics (no development experience required!), and see how we can maintain our insight into the performance of our applications.

Workarounds: many (if not all) of the schedulers require workarounds to start a properly parametrized Powershell script: a batch file, a call to powershell.exe with escaped parameter string and so on.

During this session, you’ll learn how to find performance counters and what the top 10 most important performance counters are along with their recommended values. You’ll learn how to query performance counters, create a reusable tool to query the top 10 performance counters, and automate the validation of those performance counters with Pester. Finally, you’ll learn how to create advanced validation tests for those performance counters. PowerShell Summit videos are recorded on a ""best effort"" basis.

However, as defenders began using this new visibility and significantly improving their detection of malicious PowerShell usage, attackers adapted their techniques. As attackers turned to the heavy usage of specific obfuscation techniques, like those found in Invoke-Obfuscation and Invoke-CradleCrafter, to target certain aspects of PowerShell’s ScriptBlock logging, defenders once again had to match this offensive shift with their own shift in detection methodology. Defenders have since turned to various data science approaches, like those built into Revoke-Obfuscation, to more robustly detect heavy PowerShell obfuscation. However, countering offensive projects like PSAmsi have enabled attackers to apply selective obfuscation in minimal quantities to evade specific A/V signatures while falling under the ""obfuscation threshold"" of newer data science approaches. Come learn how PesterSec combines the power of ScriptAnalyzer and Pester to perform context-specific detections of minimally-obfuscated PowerShell commands and scripts. These platforms also highlight the ease of access to PowerShell’s Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for any PowerShell practitioner. PowerShell Summit videos are recorded on a ""best effort"" basis.

However, malicious threat actors have also harnessed PowerShell’s capabilities by writing extensive offensive tools and frameworks in PowerShell. The PowerShell team has countered these malicious trends with adding numerous defensive enhancements to PowerShell including extremely deep logging visibility (like ScriptBlock, Module and Transcription logging) as well as blocking capabilities and interfaces like the AntiMalware Scan Interface (AMSI). This talk draws from over four years of Incident Response experience to lay out a technical buffet of in-the-wild malicious PowerShell payloads and techniques. In addition to diving deep into the mechanics of each malicious example, this presentation will highlight forensic artifacts, detection approaches and the deep visibility that the latest versions of PowerShell provides security practitioners to defend their organizations against the latest attacks that utilize PowerShell. So if you are new to security or just want to learn about how attackers have used PowerShell in their attacks, then this talk is for you. If you want to see what obfuscated and multi-stage, evasive PowerShell-based attacks look like under the microscope of PowerShell deep inspection capabilities, this talk is for you.

They can drive automation, monitoring and alerting, reporting, and anything else that benefits from visibility. It just so happens that: * This is a great way to illustrate the various ways to talk to things in PowerShell (modules, web APIs, .NET libraries, binaries, etc.) * Graph databases are awesome, and map to real life systems more easily than the cumbersome fun of primary keys, foreign keys, and strict schemas * Neo4j has a free, cross platform community edition, and there's a simple PowerShell module to work with it * We can instill other important lessons, e.g. modules/abstraction, community/sharing * We can provide a practical example that folks without a reasonable CMDB could borrow and extend * Heavy weight, expensive, actual CMDBs are a poor fit for shops adopting DevOps practices and principles",DevOps 2018

With the new releases of PowerShell being platform agnostic you can now build Apps that can manage ANYTHING and run ANYWHERE! Combining PowerShell with open source web platforms allows you to build custom Apps to manage heterogeneous infrastructures. There is no ‘out of the box’ perfect solution available on the market today that can help you manage your infrastructure your way. It costs too much, it's too complex, there is no way to customize it... we can always find things wrong, or have a better way of doing things... it's human nature. So, I say put your money where your mouth is, and build one yourself! You know your requirements better than anyone else! And, if you know PowerShell you are in luck! Let's continue this journey together. I have worked with many tools in the past, and they have never been quite right. I’ve always wanted more information, and extra button, remove some piece of data that I didn't care about, but the problem is that I didn’t understand the language it was written in, or didn’t have access to the source code. So I quit. I quit waiting for someone to do what I needed done, and I started building PowerShell applications to help manage my Information systems. The concept is simple, use powershell to collect data to be stored in a central location, a lightweight web application to display the data, and some business logic to apply relevant changes to the specific environments. The individual components break down into manageable pieces to include; A Queue Manager, Task Manager, Database, Web Application, and a Management service. A Task Manager can be deployed into any environment and is the workhorse of the application. It communicates with the database to input data and to get data to perform the specific workflows you have designed. All log files and related artifacts are securely stored on a CIFS share available for viewing in the User Interface. With great success, comes more challenges! Having this great distributed system was great when starting, but quickly became a pain to manage! Manually updating scripts on VM’s halfway across the world is not fun, so I wrote a management service to keep all of my systems in sync. Runtime environments needed to be managed as well as source control on the executable files. Insert Docker to resolve the runtime environment, it’s a bit overkill, but does a fantastic job at creating an exact, repeatable workspace to execute scripts. What other product will let you build and manage your complex environment of on premise, and cloud infrastructure across product lines like VMware, Active Directory, custom REST API’s, security scanning tools, and more?

Classes were introduced in PowerShell 5 and mainly to aid in writing DSC resources but can be used with non-DSC modules as well. This talk will go over some of the hidden gotchas when developing with classes including: * Importing issues * Verbose / Debug oddities * Sharing classes between modules I've developed and released a large PowerShell project (PoshBot) that primarily consists of PowerShell classes. While I could have written the module using traditional functions and cmdlets, I wanted an excuse to try classes out on a new project.

Now you can write help in markdown and verify that it reflects the code. PlatyPS brings modern markdown-based workflows to the PowerShell help authoring. We will take a deep dive in the PowerShell help engine and platyPS. PlatyPS solves a long standing pain of writing PowerShell external help xmls.It provides a way to * Write PowerShell External Help in Markdown * Generate markdown help for your existing modules * Keep markdown help up-to-date with your code * Generate help artifacts (maml xmls and online help archives) from markdown and ship them with your modules Traditionally PowerShell external help files have been authored by hand or using complex tool chains and rendered as MAML XML for use as console help. MAML is cumbersome to edit by hand, and common tools and editors don't provide good support for working with it. Markdown is a very easy markup language which became a standard for writing documentation. We will take a look at existing big projects that are using it (like Azure and PowerShell-Docs) and some smaller projects (like PSReadLine). We will go through a (very easy!) bootstrap process for using platyPS in an existing project. We will also cover how to make sure that documentation is up to date and even add tests to your CI pipeline to make sure that documentation is always updated. In the second part of the talk, we will take a deep dive into platyPS internals. We will talk about markdown schema, quirks of PowerShell help engine and tool limitations. We will also cover advanced topics, like combining few different versions of your module help into a single markdown document.

Whether it's checking files for SSNs, verifying that a password is complex enough, or updating every page in your web site, text is a pain. Now, you probably know that ""regular expressions"" could help, but aren't they really hard? Well, not if Mark Minasi's explaining them. Is that a valid email address, or just a SQL injection attack? Does that folder full of Word files contain any credit card or bank routing numbers? Does that proposed password meet our requirements? How can I easily extract just a few important bits of weather data from a page full of raw HTML? If you've been coding or scripting for any time at all, then you already know the answer -- ""regular expressions"" or ""regexes."" But if you're like most of us, regex is one of those ""I'll get around to it one day"" things, and while ""\d=digit, \s=white space, etc"" is relatively easy to learn, regex soon becomes essentially opaque. (""Isn't that line noise?"" is the one of the more polite observations one hears.) In this ""medium-deep dive,"" award-winning author, teacher and veteran of more text processing debacles than he prefers to remember Mark Minasi shines a light on how regex works and offers tips on how to get the best out of it. In this session, you'll learn a minimum of regex, which then enables us to get an in-depth knowledge of how the regex ""engine"" works -- knowledge which is the key to getting anything done in regex. Then you'll see how PowerShell's regex engine -- which is really .NET's regex engine -- can be configured and how it behaves differently from other regex engines. (It's astounding how easily you can build an infinite loop with regex, so you're REALLY going to want to know how to set up regex timeouts.) With that out of the way, we'll then cover regex syntax with lots and lots of examples, as well as some nice regex prototyping tools. Very few tools in the computing business are as old as regex or as cross-platform, and yet in the domain of text processing virtually nothing exceeds regex's power. It would, then, be a terrible shame if you didn't have some familiarity with this old friend. In short, attend this session because Mark ""sed"" so! Now and then, I get the itch to find something that's been around FOREVER, that everyone really, really OUGHT to know -- and they know it, back in that awful ""stuff I really should learn one of these days"" list we all have -- and make it useful and understandable.",DevOps 2018

You can utilise the WS-Management layer (WSMAN) directly to access a remote machine. They aren't a replacement for PowerShell remoting or CIM sessions but complement both of these technologies and supply an alternative access method.

On the local machine you have the registry provider -- but you can't use it against remote machines. For remote access you can use WMI or .NET. The WMI, CIM and WSMAN cmdlets can be used to work with the registry on remote machines. All of these cmdlets involve using large constants and an awkward syntax with no consistencies between them. This session will show you how to create your own module to work with the registry on the local or remote machines. Using the CDXML -- objects over cmdlets -- technology introduced with PowerShell 3.0 you can take the registry WMI class and make cmdlets to search for , read, write, create and delete items in the registry. Your take away is a module of cmdlets that enable you to work easily with the registry. You will aslo understend the techniques you can use to create your own cmdlets from WMI classes -- this is the way Microsoft writes many of their cmdlets.",Summit 2014

I have been interested in automation techniques (including automating job creation and submission on mainframes many years ago!). I have been using VBScript and WMI since it became available on NT 4. PowerShell caught my interest when I first heard about it and I have been using it since the early beta versions. My blog is mainly about PowerShell. I founded the UK PowerShell user Group in 2007 and I am a PowerShell MVP. I have given numerous talks on PowerShell at various events in the UK, Europe and the USA. I am a frequent speaker for PowerShell user groups worldwide. I have had a number of articles on PowerShell published including expert commentaries on the Microsoft Scripting Games for which I have been a judge for the last three years. I have written two PowerShell books: PowerShell in Practice (Manning 2010) and PowerShell and WMI (Manning 2012) and coauthored PowerShell in Depth (Manning 2013). I am currently writing an introductory book for Active Directory administrators that features PowerShell.",Summit 2013

In grading the 2000 submitted scripts, I noticed a common theme emerged. Some of the things that were consistently confused by both beginners and advanced scripters include the following: failure to return objects from functions, not creating reusable functions, spending too much duplicating capabilities of native PowerShell, using meaningless comments, omission of error handling, and an overreliance on Write-Host. In this session, I will address each of these areas of concern and show both good and bad examples from the games. A thorough discussion of each of these topics rounds out the presentation. This presentation uses live demos to illustrate the techniques that are discussed.

What if the user was an attacker attempting to circumvent security controls by exploiting a vulnerability in your script? This may sound unrealistic but this is a legitimate concern of the PowerShell team when including PowerShell code in the operating system. In a high-security environment where strict AppLocker or Device Guard rules are deployed, PowerShell exposes a large attack surface that can be used to circumvent security controls. While constrained language mode goes a long way in preventing malicious PowerShell code from executing, attackers will seek out vulnerabilities in trusted signed code in order to circumvent security controls. This talk will cover numerous different ways in which attackers can influence the execution of your code in unanticipated ways.

I had a number of success criteria that had to be met. Checking all of these by hand (eye) would have been error prone, so I wrote a test to do this for me and an easy for management to read HTML report using PowerShell and Pester. The session has come from that situation and is about enabling you to provide an easy to read output to quickly and repeatedly show that infrastructure is as expected for a set of checks. There are many use cases for this type of solution; DR testing, installation, first line checks, presentation setups After this session you will have a basic understanding of how Pester works and the capability to examine your checklists and create your own validation tests and provide some reporting for management. You will pick up ideas of processes and checks that can be automated within your company I am able to perform the following checks in 15 minutes across hundreds of servers and thousands of databases and I think it is cool and useful and everyone should be able to do so and take the functionality to create their own.

Constrained endpoints can allow your staff to work with specific components of PowerShell only, preventing the next Timmy from making a costly mistake. In this deep dive, we will take a look at PowerShell remoting and learn how to use it to deploy constrained endpoints rapidly across your organization allowing you to follow the “Principle of Least Privilege” in the PowerShell world.

I had a student from my PowerShell class take a 640 hour manual task down to just 1 hour and 20 minutes utilizing PowerShell. Automation is great, but writing code that runs faster gives you and your organization a tactical advantage. Simply put, the faster things work, the more money you save. What difference does a quarter of a second make? Well, try working in an environment of 100,000 nodes. Just a delay of .25 seconds per node will cost you an extra 7 hours. This deep dive will take a look at various ways to gauge the speed of your code execution and tactics on how to accelerate your goals through the use of methods, background jobs, and simple coding techniques. Whether it is through remoting on-premises or reaching out to the cloud, we will make things happen faster.

Many, if not all, monitoring tools will warn you if something which has been configured has gone wrong. But not a lot of them will tell you if something was never configured in the first place. In my search for a solution I ran into Pester tests, and the Operations Validation Framework (OVF) in particular. The existing OVF framework itself was not 'dynamic' enough for my needs, so I decided to roll my own. Based on the Convention over Configuration paradigm my code tests the whole landscape and can quickly identify if some configuration does not adhere to (my own) best practices or even if exceptions that I've put in place are still configured as such. I will demo based on code that is actively used in production and my samples will use SQL Server because I'm a database guy. But this session is also useful if you're not a SQL admin.

The demo module used in this session is available at the PowerShell Gallery: ""ScriptBlockLoggingAnalyzer"". You can install it like this: Install-Module ScriptBlockLoggingAnalyzer (add -Scope CurrentUser if you are not an Admin) Please note that this module currently reads only the Windows PowerShell log. PowerShell Core logs the same information but uses a different log. If you are a Core user, you may simply adjust the log names used by the module.

Come experience a technical buffet of in-the-wild malicious PowerShell payloads from 4+ years of Incident Responses & see why PowerShell’s defensive visibility is now driving many attackers away from PowerShell. For over a decade PowerShell has empowered administrators, DevOps practitioners and automation enthusiasts to accomplish significant tasks with relative ease. However, malicious threat actors have also harnessed PowerShell’s capabilities by writing extensive offensive tools and frameworks in PowerShell. The PowerShell team has countered these malicious trends with adding numerous defensive enhancements to PowerShell including extremely deep logging visibility (like ScriptBlock, Module and Transcription logging) as well as blocking capabilities and interfaces like the AntiMalware Scan Interface (AMSI). This talk draws from over four years of Incident Response experience to lay out a technical buffet of in-the-wild malicious PowerShell payloads and techniques. In addition to diving deep into the mechanics of each malicious example, this presentation will highlight forensic artifacts, detection approaches and the deep visibility that the latest versions of PowerShell provides security practitioners to defend their organizations against the latest attacks that utilize PowerShell. So if you are new to security or just want to learn about how attackers have used PowerShell in their attacks, then this talk is for you. If you want to see what obfuscated and multi-stage, evasive PowerShell-based attacks look like under the microscope of PowerShell deep inspection capabilities, this talk is for you. And if you want to see why these security advancements to PowerShell are causing many attackers to shift their tradecraft development away from PowerShell, this talk is for you.

In this session, we'll try to briefly review the why and what of DSC, decrypt all the recent news and see how it looks today, and finally make some predictions on its evolution. We'll review DSC's core principles and components, the differences between platform, solutions, resources and the community behind https://dsccommunity.org. We will discuss how third parties, such as Chef, Puppet, Ansible, but also AWS, VMWare, Cisco are leveraging the technology. Next, we'll see a demo the work done by the PowerShell team to make invoking DSC resources work from PowerShell 7 on any platform from the RFC I wrote. We will discuss scenarios, current limitations and some tricks and tips you may find useful. Finally, we can't talk about the future of DSC without spending some time on Azure Policy Guest Configuration, which leverages the new codebase of a DSC agent (sometimes called DSCv2 or LCMv2). We'll look at how you can leverage DSC resources, enact changes, and how hybrid scenarios can be addressed with Azure ARC.
